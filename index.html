        <p class="lead mb-4"> Looking back seven months earlier, 28th December 2022, my journal entry read, " dull oily face, gloomy eyes, increasingly skinny arms, a receding hairline with grey hairs, constant stomach pain and digestion issues, no confidence in life, i am drinking and inhaling shit i dont even want to, i cant sleep, a disappointment to my family, maybe i have chosen the wrong career path?" <br>
          The past six months have helped me introspect and understand my life, my mental and physical health in a way I couldn't even imagine. I learnt, experimented, lost, got up and tried again. But in all these contexts, I want to tell you that I am not here to inspire or motivate you. There are thousands of professionals out on social media who can inspire you for free. <br>
          Rather, I want to give an insight into how to start. How I started, what I went through and how I am feeling in this phase. The phase when you havn't reached anything but there's a light which gives you hope, confidence and energy to go on. Remember no matter how much pain and suffering you experience, it will never be big enough to hold you back.

      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">My past in brief</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> Since childhood, I have had health issues which have been the only constant in my life. When I was just two, I got diagnosed with pneumonia and typhoid at the same time and since then tonsilitis, fever, body pain, have become regular occurrences for me. In class 9 I suffered from Pharyngitis which worsened my voice and i was sure I could never sing. <br>
          The constant high dose of medication led to stomach problems and indigestion. Among all these, I never really felt attached or interested in academic life. Yes, I had extreme social anxiety when I was young. I was not good at sports either. I remember once when I was in 3rd grade I gathered my courage to step out and play with the local boys who were a few years older than me. The only thing I did that day was take out their cricket balls from the sewers.
          <br>Things changed when my family moved to a new place, and these new people and unknown faces gave me the confidence to start a new chapter which I did. I became better at sports especially football. I started to enjoy spending time with outsiders, playing and talking to them. So yeah, sometimes starting off fresh can be fruitful.
          <br>It is no secret that I am a nerd, always have been, the one who studies before an exam and gets extraordinary marks, skyrocketing my parents' expectations </p>

    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center">
      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">High school academics: The moment I realised</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> As i said, i was never consistent with studies and hence in high school when i took science as my major, a huge academic downfall was on its way. Online exams delayed my realisation that I couldn't clear this subject and with every passing day my and my family's dream of seeing me graduate from a top tier engineering college fell further away. 
          I once again gathered my courage to tell them that I am not capable of clearing engineering exams and this high school stress has given me enough trauma to even think about pursuing it. They were shocked , they didnt accept me , told me it was just my way of escaping from reality that I always have done. Where was I escaping?</p>

    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center">
      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">Escapism</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> It was sometimes impossible for me to sleep, so I kept using my phone to distract me from my thoughts. The habit became stronger over time. Staying alone with your thoughts is scary. No one wants to and that's why we always try to be busy isn't it? 
          <br>One thing I am grateful for is understanding the difference between escaping life and enjoying life. Dreams can't be achieved in one day, if they are, your goal is too small. It takes time and consistency, okay yes these cliches have been spoken about everywhere but what exactly is the difference between escaping and enjoying. 
          <br>If dreams cannot be achieved in one day, a portion of your efforts will lead you there, and that is what is truly satisfying. Consistently putting effort into your goals and spending your time on them. Escapism is when you spend time doing things that won't get you anywhere instead of accomplishing your daily tasks. When you spend time on stuffs which gives you pleasure or kicks in dopamine and at the same time you manage to put in the efforts for your goals and take care of your responsibilities, that's enjoying life. No aspect of your life is being escaped, you have earned that time to enjoy it!
          <br>During school, my life consisted of gaming at home, playing outside if possible, attending tuitions at noon and repeating the cycle. I wonder how many people might relate to it. This addiction to playing mobile games to escape from life was a habit since my 5th standard. Trust me, when I was in class 12 I had no hobbies.</p>

      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">Your thoughts need to be heard</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> There's a sense of emptiness when you are constantly working on yourself the whole day. Your subconscious mind is gathering thoughts even when you are busy. Your present mind is constantly wondering about the future. Dont you think all these thoughts need to be heard. Doesn't matter if it's communicated to a human or on a piece of paper. Your thoughts define you. They are NOT meant to be suppressed. 
          <br>At times when we don't allow space for our thoughts and confront them, we tend to show toxic traits in our lives. A family member, a friend, or even ourselves could be impacted by it. No wonder western regions have normalised therapy to a much greater extent than Asian ones
          <br>It has taken me a long time to examine these feelings, and I have tried to correct them. In my opinion, it is very important to know what you are going through, in order to grow. But one thing I am thankful for is having a great friend circle. Every friend of mine is unique and has their own qualities that inspire me. Also those best friends I talk to and vent to daily. To each and every person I have known, cheers.</p>

      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">The glow up everyone deserves.</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> Everyone expected me to be an engineer. My family, my friends and my teachers all thought I would become one and also why not when literally any kind of student is getting admission to a Btech college? Everything I did was to become good at it. I never wanted to be average at anything. Despite this, the enormous syllabus and academic intensity degraded my health. My skin looked pale, I was skinny, and I kept trying to escape from studying the subjects I had begun to dislike. 
          <br>After averaging a Btech degree that I know will give me constant stress in life and will never allow me to grow physically and mentally, I wondered what I would do? It was time, I had to make a decision and I did. In the end, I opted for a bachelor's degree, sort of less stressful but which requires a lot of effort to land a good job. Due to my decision to pursue it, my parents have always accused me of being weak, indecisive, and afraid. I had to prove myself. Ultimately, their main concern is my well-being, which is why they always forced me to do an overhyped degree.
          <br>I have completed my first year. Now i am more fit than i ever was, i lift weights regularly, i look comparatively better than before , i have a fixed sleep schedule and most importanly i have hope to keep going and the confidence to face the reality. I want to share what i did in the last 6-7 months , how i started and how i am planning to continue.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center">
      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">My first steps</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> I started this year as everyone does, full of hopes and targets to complete before the year ends. But this time my approach was different. Having been annoyed with myself for a long time, I desperately wanted a change. 
          Firstly, I started off by seeking medical attention. I approached a dermatologist and a gastroentrologist and became regular with medications. Turns out investing medically to treat the flaws of your body is one of the best investments. I started feeling better with time when my skin looked clear and bright, less stomach pain and better hair growth. I am still undergoing the treatement but i feel good enough to have real hope.          
          <br>Then came the real breakthrough. Hitting the gym. If you have enough free time in your hand after completing your day, my friend you have to hit the damn gym. It boosts your self-awareness to a point you cant imagine. I made a workout routine and fixed my food intake. If I had to briefly point out the important things I learnt from the gym was , drinking a lot of water, cutting off oily and fast foods, with each meal try to have a protein source followed up with veggies or salad and to understand the workout-muscle relation.
          <br>With my studies, I have always struggled, and I still am struggling. But there hasnt been a single day I didnt try to sit and cover a part of my syllabus or to learn a new skill. 
          One thing i wanted to share with every boy was, NO! Masturbation doesnt help you in anyway! Stop living in a fake reality and end your habit of masturbating. I havent masturbated since last year and i feel this is one of the reasons why i am more energetic , confident and have a positive mindset. 
          <br>Another aspect i wanted to fix was my screen time. Instead of watching more web series , movies or playing games , I replaced them with music, guitar, books and playing football in real life. Of course, I couldn't do it in one day. It took me atleat 1.5 years to learn guitar to some extent, and i still am getting used to reading books. All i am saying is that whatever i started, i had faith and patience to get back up, and now i couldnt thank my older self enough for it.

    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center">
      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">The power of prayer</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> Several events in my life have made me question the existence of god. Why don't my prayers get answered or fulfilled, is there even a deity above who listens to me? What if it's all made up? As time passed by during my high school, I lost all my trust in god and was proudly claiming myself to be an atheist. I used to joke about god's existence , that they dont care about us. I was wrong!          
          <br>In the past few months another big realisation I had was the power of prayers. Why are we praying? What do prayers even offer? 
          God exists. But he or she is not there to fix us, rather to energise us with a sense of hope and freedom through prayers! Use prayer to strengthen you, to uplift your self-belief, to improve your focus and most importantly to become a better person. You can't stop what is going to happen but you can always improve what God has given you, your very own body and personality.

    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center">
      <h5 class="display-5 text-body-emphasis">Your mindset defines you</h5>
      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> Do you have this phase of the day just scrolling through your phone anxiously? You are not really able to process the content you are watching but you still continue. Well, yes it used to happen to me a lot. It still does but the frequency has decreased now. The problem is that our mind just doesn't want to go through the tough part of reality, doesn't it? I still wonder how people manage to avoid distractions. What if they are missing out on the fun part of life?          
          <br>In one book, I read that the way you identify yourself determines how your brain works and channels energy for you. Thus, if you consider yourself a good artist, you are likely to draw more, but mindset plays a major role here. You can never be perfect or good at anything on the first try, so you must learn to deal with humiliation and keep going. That's what a real mindset is.
          Remind yourself that you are capable. Be strong, strong enough that you never look weak even if you are a tall skinny guy! The world is a shithole. You either protect yourself or suffer. 
          <br>For me life isn't a race. I never compared myself to anyone, I never felt the need to. One thing that makes me happy is that I know more about life now than I did few months ago, and I know I will continue to learn. So what's up? Why are you still comparing yourself to others? Or what makes you think you're the best when each person has their own distinctive past and is exceptional in their own way?

      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> The more i started working on myself, the more i realised how empty it feels everyday even when i was surrounded with people. Everyone is struggling with their life and i wonder how many people go through this feeling and cant figure it out. I urge people to observe your feelings more and understand how your life and mental health corresponds to each other. As I said my intention is not to make it a motivational blog but rather I am writing this to share why and how I started. And most importantly, I am writing this for myself, to remind me how strong I am, to remind us of how strong we are!

          Honestly, I have no idea what life holds for me or where I will be in the future. However, that doesn't discourage me from continuing. For me, this is the beauty of life. You never know where u will end up but one thing is for sure, that u can keep growing from any point of your life
